#OVERVIEW

Originally started as a learning exercise for Haxe development. The API, structure, and license of this project is subject to change. Look into the more mature [minject](/massiveinteractive/minject) by Massive Interactive if you are looking for a more stable library.

There are plans to release to Haxelib in the future but a few more features, documentation and a solid build/release process will have to be put in place first. 

Currently supports 
* Contructor, property, and method injection
* Injection of Enums and dynamic creation of enums with contructor arguments
* Custom metadata

Feel free to contact [clarkjones](/clarkjones) with any questions/comments.  

More info to come.
