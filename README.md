#OVERVIEW

Originally started as a learning exercise for Haxe development. The API and structure of this project is subject to change. Look into the more mature [mmvc](http://github.com/massiveinteractive/mmvc) and [minject](http://github.com/massiveinteractive/minject) by Massive Interactive if you are looking for a more stable library.

There are plans to release to Haxelib in the future but a few more features and a solid build/release process & documentation will have to be put in place first. 

Currently has support for:
* Contructor, property, and method injection
* Injection of Enums
* Injection into Enums with constructors
* Custom metadata

Feel free to contact [clarkjones](http://github.com/clarkjones) with any questions/comments.  

More info to come.
